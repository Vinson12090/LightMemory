# Pre-work - *Memory Game*

**Memory Game** is a Light & Sound Memory game to apply for CodePath's SITE Program. 

Submitted by: **Vinson Lin**

Time spent: **3** hours spent in total

Link to project: (insert your link here, should start with https://glitch.com...)

## Required Functionality

The following **required** functionality is complete:

* [x] Game interface has a heading (h1 tag), a line of body text (p tag), and four buttons that match the demo app
* [x] "Start" button toggles between "Start" and "Stop" when clicked. 
* [x] Game buttons each light up and play a sound when clicked. 
* [x] Computer plays back sequence of clues including sound and visual cue for each button
* [x] Play progresses to the next turn (the user gets the next step in the pattern) after a correct guess. 
* [x] User wins the game after guessing a complete pattern
* [x] User loses the game after an incorrect guess

The following **optional** features are implemented:

* [ ] Any HTML page elements (including game buttons) has been styled differently than in the tutorial
* [ ] Buttons use a pitch (frequency) other than the ones in the tutorial
* [ ] More than 4 functional game buttons
* [ ] Playback speeds up on each turn
* [ ] Computer picks a different pattern each time the game is played
* [ ] Player only loses after 3 mistakes (instead of on the first mistake)
* [x] Game button appearance change goes beyond color (e.g. add an image)
* [ ] Game button sound is more complex than a single tone (e.g. an audio file, a chord, a sequence of multiple tones)
* [ ] User has a limited amount of time to enter their guess on each turn

The following **additional** features are implemented:

- [ ] List anything else that you can get done to improve the app!

## Reflection Questions
1. If you used any outside resources to help complete your submission (websites, books, people, etc) list them here. 

  I did not use any outside resources other than what was provided for me from the Codepath Prework website.

2. What was a challenge you encountered in creating this submission (be specific)? How did you overcome it? (recommended 200 - 400 words) 

Honestly when going through the project I did not really encounter any challenges because of how the tutorial was formatted as it was extremely helpful in the creation of the project as it not only gave us the steps into how to create the project but also helped explain what each line of code did and how it operates. Along with mini-tabs that helped explain things such as pseudo classes and in addition to gifs that showed us, what the project should look like so far. But if I were to describe a challenge it would be how overwhelming it can be to get into a new language as my primary language that I’ve been learning the last few years have been C++ so Javascript was pretty new to me but I do see some similarities and how their foreloops work that I was able to read the lines of code and understand how it operates. Along with just simple google searching of specific stuff had helped me in overcoming that problem. 

3. What questions about web development do you have after completing your submission? (recommended 100 - 300 words) 


Some questions that I have about web development would be some more specific functions that you would often see in a web page such as a drop down menu and things such as the ability to store passwords and log in into their database and how cloud works in keeping these websites on at all times. Along with how you would create a database that would operate as the backbone of the website and more of the specifics of how backend and front end interact with each other are some of the many questions that I have after completing my submission.


4. If you had a few more hours to work on this project, what would you spend them doing (for example: refactoring certain functions, adding additional features, etc). Be specific. (recommended 100 - 300 words) 


If I had a few more hours to work on this project, I would want to implement some of the optional features that were recommended to me in the pre-work website such as creating a randomized pattern instead of a set pattern that the game would follow using math.random. Something else that I would want to implement would be Timer because it’s a combination of both front and backend to create it so it’s a lot more tricky compared to the other optional features that were recommended to us. But something that I really wanted to mess with would be the option to reset and go back to the beginning of the game. This is because in our project, we only made it so it  would run until you either won or lost but there was never a way to restart other than just refreshing the project.
